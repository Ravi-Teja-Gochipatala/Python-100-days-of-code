## What I Learn

- **Datatype:- A datatype defines the type of a Data or Value, a Variable can hold and what Operations can be performed on it.**
- **There are Different data types, like Numeric types (int, float, Complex ), Text type (Str), and Boolean type (bool)**
- **Numeric types are supports all arithmetic operations like ( +, -, *, /, %)**
- **Text type (str is short for string)**
- **String:- a String is a series of characters, and in Python, anything inside of double quotes “ “ is a string.**
- **Boolean type is a Unique Data type that is based on True or False**
- **I also learn about Python’s type() function, which is helpful to find the type of the data.**
