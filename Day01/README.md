#What is a Variable?

$Variable:- In programming, a Variable is a named storage location of a memory that holds a value

Example

#Rules for Declaring Python Variables 
- Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.

- A variable can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number

Example:- we can start a variable message_1 but not 1_message

- Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names

Example:- "greeting_message" is a valid variable, but "greeting message" is not 

- Avoid using Python reserved keywords as variable and function names

Variable names should be short but descriptive
