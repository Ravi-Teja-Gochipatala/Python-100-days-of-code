# Day 1 - Variables in Python

## 📖 What I Learned
#What is a Variable?

$Variable:- In programming, a Variable is a named storage location of a memory that holds a value

Example
Message = "Hello, 100daysofcode!"
print(Message)
#Rules for Declaring Python Variables 
- Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.

- A variable can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number

Example:- we can start a variable message_1 but not 1_message

- Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names

Example:- "greeting_message" is a valid variable, but "greeting message" is not 

- Avoid using Python reserved keywords as variable and function names

Variable names should be short but descriptive 

## **Python Comments**

- **Comments are helpful to document the code, how it works, what its importance is, etc.**
- **Python interpreter ignores Comments during program execution.**

### Python has two types of Comments

### i)Single-line Comments

- **It starts with # and is used to comment line by line.**

### ii)Multi-line Comments

- **it start’s with tripule double quotes  “”” ”””  or  tripule single  quotes ‘’’ ‘’’  and used to comment a block of text or paragraph.**

**The shortcut-key to Comment any number of lines is Ctrl + /**
